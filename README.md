# Elytra ESP

![A Elytra wearing piglin being highlighted by the mod](https://github.com/underscore-zi/flying-pigs-esp/blob/master/mod-example.png?raw=true)

Meteor module to highlight any elytra item on the ground and/or any mob wearing an elytra.

# Install

Download the latest dev build from the [Releases page](https://github.com/therealmeteor/elytra-esp/releases) and install like any other Meteor module.

# Auditing

There are malicious mods out there, and you might not trust me.

The project is a fork of [Flying Pigs ESP](https://github.com/underscore-zi/flying-pigs-esp), which in turn is a fork of [Meteor Addon Template](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-addon-template/tree/master), so you can see exactly what I changed from a presumably trusted root. This includes the build and release workflows which come directly from Meteor, so you can trust that the releases are built with the same source code as is present in the repo.
